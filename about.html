      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>I grew up in a small country town in a large family. When you grow up as one of the youngest of sixteen children, you tend to develop a tough skin and tendency to reject tradition for tradition's sake. I put myself through college, both undergrad and graduate school, and maintained a high GPA throughout.</p>

      <p>Now that I am a few years into my professional career with a Masters degree in Architecture, I have learned much about myself and my passion for the industry.  The skills I gained during my time at university have allowed me to become a leader at my current office, for management of company software, office standards and training of new employees.   These skills I have and continue to learn put me at the forefront of the architecture profession.  I have already had the opportunity to work with great architects and applied many of my skills I learned over the years.  In pursuit to always be learning and advancing through my career, I am open to what adventures the future might hold for me.</p>

      <p>I will take on the challenges of the architecture profession and make a positive impact for the neighborhoods, communities, and environments that I design for. With better technologies and ideas, we have the resources we need to take on those challenges and transform the world around us. My unconventional background gives me a unique perspective on the architectural challenges we face and allows me to better serve the community.<p/>
